title: Ready for Alpha Testing

Peer Review is ready for alpha testing to begin in earnest. If you're
interested in helping out, here's what you can do.

You can find the alpha on the [staging infrastructure](https://staging.peer-review.io).

We need people to put it through its paces. We need feedback on how intuitive
the UX is and where we need to add more explanation and documentation, or redo
the UX to be clearer.  And, of course, we need help testing it thoroughly to spot
any remaining bugs.

Once you have an account and initial reputation, you can try publishing a
paper, posting some reviews, and posting some responses.  If you aren't able to
generate enough reputation from your ORCID iD, reach out ( [email](contact@peer-review.io), [twitter](https://twitter.com/PeerReviewIo) ) and we can generate
fake reputation for you so that you can interact with the rest of the platform.

In addition to feedback on the UX, we're looking for any bugs that crop up. If
you find a bug you can let us know in one of several ways:

- You can email us at [contact@peer-review.io](mailto:contact@peer-review.io)
- You can DM us (or just tweet at us) on Twitter [@peerreviewio](https://twitter.com/PeerReviewIo)
- You can post a [bug issue](https://github.com/danielBingham/peerreview/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md) on Github.
- You can join the [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/peer-review-io/shared_invite/zt-1hocmaafn-7dr~wuqnasfFMRXygD_HxA) and post in #bugs.

Choose the method that works best for you!

We're aiming to begin a initial semi-closed beta in early November.  For the
initial beta period, we're going to increase the reputation required to publish
to be 2x the average reputation per paper in each field.  Anyone will still be
able to read the site, but to participate you will need to have initial
reputation.  When we go from initial, semi-closed beta to open beta the
reputation required to publish will be set back to zero.

We're generating initial reputation from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) using [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org) to confirm
identity. OpenAlex has a lot of data, but they don't have all of it.  So we're
working on additional ways to generate initial reputation.

Provided alpha testing goes smoothly, the beta should begin in early November.
So stay tuned!
